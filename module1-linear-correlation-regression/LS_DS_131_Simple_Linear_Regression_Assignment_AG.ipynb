    "The `Brainhead.csv` dataset provides information on 237 individuals who were subject to post-mortem examination at the Middlesex Hospital in London around the turn of the 20th century. Study authors used cadavers to see if a relationship between brain weight and other more easily measured physiological characteristics such as age, sex, and head size could be determined. The end goal was to develop a way to estimate a person’s brain size while they were still alive (as the living aren’t keen on having their brains taken out and weighed). \n",
