But then you forget to drop one of the columns so you end up with two columns that are linearly dependent which causes the determinant of your dataframe to be 0 and will cause certain algorithms to fail. We'll go deeper into this concept next week (this can cause problems with linear regression) so just know that matrices that have columns that are a multiple or fraction of another column will cause the determinant of that matrix to be 0."
