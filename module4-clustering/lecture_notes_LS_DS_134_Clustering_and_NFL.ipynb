Principal Components are a linear combination of any and all dimensions (features) that will increase their variance, this means that PCs are made up of a mixture of features --mostly the ones with the highest variance, but also smaller parts from other features. This means that they are not comparable to the original features of our $X$ matrix. In cases where we're not reducing dimensionality that much (like the Iris dataset) our Principal Components might be extremely similar to the original features (since there's not that many to pull from) but don't think of them in that way, think of them as a completely new dataset that we can't really apply "

For example, if I wanted to find the centroid of all of the points in the above graph I would just calculate the average of the dataset's x-coordinates to find the x value of the centroid, and the average of the dataset's y-coordinates to find the y value of the centroid.\n",

        "If we plot the centroid on the graph you'll see that it lies in the middle of the points. You could imagine the centroid as if it is the center of gravity, or center of mass for a given cluster. Since in this example we're treating all of the points in the dataset as if they're in the same cluster, it will end up somewhere in the middle. We're just doing this to demonstrate what a centroid is. The K-means algorithm doesn't ever calculate the centroid for the entire dataset."

You can do a lot of scatterplots to examine this or you could, I dunno, use a technique that maximizes the variance along certain dimensions transforming the data into principal components and then cluster along the dimensions of the principal components. \n",
